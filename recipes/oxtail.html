    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Oxtail stew with butter beans is one of Jamaica’s most beloved comfort
      foods. Slow-cooked until the meat is fall off the bone tender, this hearty
      stew is rich, flavorful, and deeply satisfying. The butter beans soak up
      the savory gravy, adding creaminess and balance to the bold spices. Served
      with rice and peas or white rice, it is a true yaad classic that brings
      warmth to any table.
