    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Oxtail stew with butter beans is one of Jamaica’s most beloved comfort
      foods. Slow-cooked until the meat is fall off the bone tender, this hearty
      stew is rich, flavorful, and deeply satisfying. The butter beans soak up
      the savory gravy, adding creaminess and balance to the bold spices. Served
      with rice and peas or white rice, it is a true yaad classic that brings
      warmth to any table.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>3 pounds oxtail</li>
      <li>2 medium onions</li>
      <li>4 medium carrots</li>
      <li>1 clove garlic</li>
      <li>1 cup tomatoes</li>
      <li>4 teaspoons cornflour</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons black pepper</li>
      <li>1/4 cup vegetable oil</li>
      <li>4 rashers streaky bacon</li>
      <li>8 cups hot water</li>
      <li>2 stalks escallion</li>
      <li>1 sprig thyme</li>
      <li>2 cans butter beans</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Cut the oxtail into bite-sized pieces, slice the onions and carrots,
        crush the garlic, chop the tomatoes, and finely chop the escallion.
      </li>
      <li>
        Trim away any excess fat and scald the oxtail pieces in boiling water
        for 2–3 minutes. Pat dry with absorbent paper, coat with cornflour, and
        season with salt and black pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a heavy-bottom pot and brown the oxtail on all sides. Pour
        off any excess oil.
      </li>
      <li>Dice the bacon and fry for a few minutes.</li>
      <li>
        Return the oxtail to the pot with the bacon, along with the carrots,
        onions, garlic, tomatoes, and hot water.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover and simmer gently for about 3 hours, or until the oxtail is almost
        tender. (A pressure cooker can be used to reduce cooking time.)
      </li>
      <li>Add more liquid if needed and adjust the seasoning.</li>
      <li>Cover and simmer for an additional 20–30 minutes.</li>
      <li>Stir in the butter beans and heat through before serving.</li>
    </ol>
