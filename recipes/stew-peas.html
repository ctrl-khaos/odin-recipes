    <p>
      Stew Peas is a hearty Jamaican classic, brimming with tender red kidney
      beans, salted meat, and rich coconut milk. Slow-cooked with spices, thyme,
      and scotch bonnet pepper, it delivers a perfect balance of savory and
      comforting flavors. Traditionally served with dumplings, rice, or bread,
      this dish is a true taste of yaad and a staple at family tables across the
      island

      <li>4 cups water</li>
      <li>6 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>2 bay leaves</li>
      <li>1 large onion, diced</li>
      <li>1 tsp grated ginger</li>
      <li>6 pimento seeds, whole</li>
      <li>Black peppercorns, ground</li>
      <li>2–3 green Scotch bonnet peppers, whole</li>
      <li>1 medium carrot, peeled and diced</li>
      <li>2 tsp thyme leaves</li>

      <li>1/2 green sweet/bell pepper, diced</li>
      <li>1/2 cup coconut milk (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Soak the pigtails overnight in a bowl of water in the refrigerator to
        remove excess salt. Discard the water and set the pigtails aside. If
        you’re short on time, place the pigtails in a pot half-filled with
        water, boil for about 30 minutes, and discard the salted water.
      </li>
      <li>
        Rinse the red peas to remove any residues and soak them in 2 cups of
        water for about 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a pressure cooker, combine the pigtails, beef, soaked peas with their
        water, garlic, onion, and ginger. Add 4 more cups of water, seal the
        cooker, and pressure cook for about 30 minutes, or until the meat and
        peas are tender. Follow your pressure cooker’s instructions.
      </li>
      <li>
        To thicken the stew, remove 1 cup of the cooked peas with a slotted
        spoon and blend them with 1 cup of the stew liquid, coconut milk, and 1
        tbsp corn starch until smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour the blended mixture back into the pot and stir well. Add the diced
        carrots and simmer over medium heat for about 5 minutes, until the gravy
        thickens and the carrots are cooked.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in the thyme leaves and sweet peppers, and simmer for another 3
        minutes.
      </li>
    </ol>
