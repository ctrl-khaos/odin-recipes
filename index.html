    <h2><em>From pot to plate, the yaadman way.</em></h2>

    <p>
      Welcome to Yaadman Recipes, this is my little corner of the net where I
      will be sharing a taste of home. In Jamaica food has always been more than
      just a meal. It is how we celebrate, connect, and carry on tradition.
      Below you will find some of my favourite recipes from yaad,
      <em>full a flava and haat</em>. Think of it less like a cookbook and more
      of me sharing my favourite dishes from the pot.
