# odin-recipes

September 16, 2025

This is my first project in The Odin Project. In this project, I used the skills I learned from the HTML Foundations course to build a basic recipe website.

The project shows my understanding of basic HTML including:

- Using elements, links, and images
- Navigating directories
- Making commits with Git

I also added a personal touch to this project, so it isnâ€™t an exact copy of the instructions, just some minor customizations.
